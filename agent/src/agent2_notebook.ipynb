The goal\\nof quantization is to reduce computational requirements and decrease memory usage while maintaining\\nacceptable model accuracy.\\n1.1.2\\nTVM (Tensor Virtual Machine)\\nTVM is an open-source compiler stack inspired by Halide that optimizes and deploys deep learning\\nmodels on various hardware platforms. It aims to enable machine learning engineers to optimize and\\nrun computations efficiently on any hardware backend.\\nTVM comprises two optimization layers. The first layer focuses on computation graph optimization,\\naddressing high-level dataflow rewriting. The second layer, the tensor optimization layer, introduces\\nnew schedule primitives to optimize memory reuse across threads, leverage tensorized compute in-\\ntrinsics, and improve latency hiding techniques.\\nFor example, optimization schedules involve loop\\nreordering, axis splitting, cache read/write definitions, and more. These schedules enable developers\\nto fine-tune computation execution, harness hardware-specific optimizations, and eliminate the need\\nfor manual design.\\n1.2\\nThe Problem\\nThere has been many papers in academic literature on quantizing weight tensors in deep learning\\nmodels to reduce inference latency and memory footprint.\\nTVM also has the ability to quantize', metadata={'Published': '2023-08-19', 'Title': 'Analyzing Quantization in TVM', 'Authors': 'Mingfei Guo', 'Summary': 'There has been many papers in academic literature on quantizing weight\\ntensors in deep learning models to reduce inference latency and memory\\nfootprint. TVM also has the ability to quantize weights and support low-bit\\ncomputations. Although quantization is typically expected to improve inference\\ntime, in TVM, the performance of 8-bit quantization does not meet the\\nexpectations. Typically, when applying 8-bit quantization to a deep learning\\nmodel, it is usually expected to achieve around 50% of the full-precision\\ninference time. However, in this particular case, not only does the quantized\\nversion fail to achieve the desired performance boost, but it actually performs\\nworse, resulting in an inference time that is about 2 times as slow as the\\nnon-quantized version. In this project, we thoroughly investigate the reasons\\nbehind the underperformance and assess the compatibility and optimization\\nopportunities of 8-bit quantization in TVM. We discuss the optimization of two\\ndifferent types of tasks: computation-bound and memory-bound, and provide a\\ndetailed comparison of various optimization techniques in TVM. Through the\\nidentification of performance issues, we have successfully improved\\nquantization by addressing a bug in graph building.
